### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It is good to have you visiting my Github! In here you can see mostly my school lecture notes and projects, which can be a useful resource if you're learning data science and machine learning.

- I am Mark. I am very passionate about pets, most especially animals, I've got 4 (Pomeranian, Westie, Frenchie and Husky-Akita mix).
- Prior to my Data Science journey, I worked with the BPO industry mostly, but also experienced FinTech, Medical and Transportation. From these jobs, I always get assigned to working with Customer Experience data. So eversince, I've been exposed to analytics, but only equipped with my knowledge on MS Excel and SharePoint.
- My passion for working with data drove me to completing my Data Science course to get expertise on machine learning and analytics.
